# CryptPad Guide

This repository is intended to help you get the most out of CryptPad.

If you're new to CryptPad, we recommend getting started by reading our [simplified user guide](users/index).

If you're already familiar with the platform and you'd like to set up your own instance, see our [setup guide](admins/index).

Finally, if you already know how to set up an instance and you'd like to tinker with CryptPad's code or audit its security properties, you can review our [developers guide](devs/index).
