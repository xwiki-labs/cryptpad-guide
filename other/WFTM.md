# Write The Fine Manual

Even though this software is open-source, certain aspects of its design, implementation, or intended configuration may occasionally reside solely in the minds of its developers.
It is often as much work to communicate these things as to implement them.

While we are happy to answer questions via our public chat room, email, and various social media accounts, doing so on an individual basis is time-consuming and of limited value to anyone not actively monitoring such channels.
Furthermore, our software is constantly evolving, guaranteeing that at some point its documentation will become incomplete or incorrect.

In the interest of solving both of these problems and the additional issue of motivating us to share all of this information we have decided to actively promote **the WTFM philosophy**.
_WTFM_, or _Write The Fine Manual_, is a social contract stipulating that we while it is our responsibility to share our insider knowledge it becomes a communal responsibility once we do.

Put more clearly, we will happily spend our time answering relevant questions under the assumption that those asking them will help others by documenting our responses in this public repository.
Helping us to make this project more transparent helps everyone else that might share your interest, now or in the future.
