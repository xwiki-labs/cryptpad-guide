# Getting the most out of CryptPad

## Background information

### CryptPad's mission

Born as it was of a company with more than a decade of experience producing open-source wiki software, CryptPad embodies the belief that the social production and stewardship of knowledge is a critical activity of a thriving populace.
The ability to organize information shapes our potential to recognize patterns and thus to shape the world around us.

While we acknowledge the immense value of openly licensed data as a common good for society, we also recognize that much of the information we produce daily concerns our private lives.
The facts we reveal about ourselves in conversation and other social activities are routinely recorded and used to profile us, and ultimately to influence our behaviour to turn us into better shoppers, voters, or followers.

Nobody should have to sacrifice convenience for privacy.
CryptPad exists to give users control over their information, their relationships, and thus their lives.
